## 📚 Overview  
This repository contains my complete coursework for **CIS‑3030: Business Web Page Development** at **Metropolitan State University of Denver**. The class is built around the *New Perspectives on HTML5 & CSS: Comprehensive, 8th Edition* textbook by Patrick M. Carey, and focuses on modern, standards‑based frontend development.

The course emphasizes **semantic HTML**, **CSS layout systems**, **responsive design**, **accessibility**, and **introductory JavaScript** — all foundational skills that now support my professional work in bilingual, accessible web development.

## 🧩 Coursework Structure  
The class is organized into **10 textbook chapters**, each containing three components:

### **1. Tutorials (10 total)**  
Guided, chapter‑based exercises introducing new concepts such as:  
- Semantic HTML structure  
- CSS selectors, typography, and color  
- Flexbox and Grid layout systems  
- Forms, media, and tables  
- Responsive design techniques  
- Introductory JavaScript and DOM manipulation  

### **2. Reviews (10 total)**  
Short, targeted challenges designed to:  
- Reinforce chapter concepts

- Improve structure and accessibility  
- Apply skills without step‑by‑step instructions  

### **3. Case Problems (10 total)**  
Mini‑projects simulating real‑world client scenarios:  
- Multi‑page layouts  
- Navigation systems  
- Responsive refactoring
