# **Foundational Web Development Coursework (CIS 3030)**  
_A curated collection of assignments demonstrating core front‑end development skills._

## 📘 Overview  
This repository contains my completed coursework for **CIS 3030: Business Web Page Development** at **MSU Denver**. The goal of this repo is to present a clean, professional record of the foundational web development skills I learned and applied throughout the semester.

Rather than uploading dozens of individual homework files, this repo provides a **single, organized, portfolio‑friendly summary** of the course, along with a link to the full assignments page.

## 🧠 What This Course Covered  
Throughout CIS 3030, I built a strong foundation in modern front‑end development, including:

- Semantic **HTML5** structure  
- Responsive **CSS3** layout and design  
- Introductory **JavaScript** for interactivity  
- Accessibility principles (WCAG 2.1 AA)  
- Media embedding and captioning  
- Forms, tables, and data presentation  
- Version control with Git & GitHub  
- Professional workflow and documentation  

These fundamentals now support my work as a bilingual web developer and designer.
